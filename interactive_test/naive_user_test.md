# User test results 

## User test 1

### Background

October 7, 4:05 to 4:40 pm.  User is a grad student with a biochemistry background.  The test took about 35 minutes total including instructions, 20 minutes of observation, explanations, and a brief post-test discussion.  Errors in the portal service prevented this from being a complete test. Recorded video was discarded after analysis.  

### Issues and comments from post-test discussion 
* list download - no feedback. 
* list download file name: 
   * prompt user for name? 
   * compose name from first few words of list name?  (e.g., "word1_word2_phylotastic_list.txt")
