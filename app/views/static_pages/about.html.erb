    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>What we do</h2>
       Until recently, expert knowledge on phylogenetic relationships-- the Tree of Life-- was scattered in thousands of inaccessible publications.  Then the <a href="http://opentree.org">OpenTree project</a> processed thousands of publications to generate a "synthetic tree" covering millions of species, a resource with enormous potential both for educational purposes and to guide research.  
       <p>Yet, there is still a very large accessibility gap, making it unlikely that this  trove of knowlewdge will flow into the hands of scientists, educators, and the public.  </p>
       <p>The Phylotastic project aims to lower the barriers to accessing the tree of life: we want to make getting a species tree just as easy-- and as fast-- as getting online driving directions.  We solve problems involved in using scientific names, extracting relationships, integrating time-scales, and finding images and other resources about species. </p>
     <h2>How it works</h2>
     For users, the part of the phylotastic system that you see is something like the <a href="http://phylo.cs.nmsu.edu:3000/">web portal</a> or the mobile app.  However, these are just 2 of many possible <b>front-ends</b> or "clients" using an underlying toolbox of <b>phylotastic web services</b>, each with a defined role providing data or operations.  For instance, we have a server that maintains species lists both for the portal and for our mobile app.  Many of our services rely on key information resources such as: 
      <ul>
      <li>OpenTree, TreeBASE - phylogenetic relationships 
      <li>Encyclopedia of Life - images, information for mash-ups
      <li>Global Names Recognition and Discovery - finding name-like strings and validating them against taxonomic databases
      <li>iNaturalist - occurrence records matching a species with a location      	
      <li>DateLife - chronograms (trees with dates based on the fossil record)
      </ul>
   We aim to grow this toolbox into a sustainable community resource that is open to anyone and that evolves to integrate new resources and operations.  
     <p>
     Each web service plays a
     <h2>How to get involved</h2>
  	The Phylotastic project is in many ways an <b>open</b> project.  We maintain a <a href="https://gitter.im/phylotastic/phylotastic">public channel</a> for project information. Our source code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/phylotastic">github</a>.  We welcome feedback and are open to new opportunities to collaborate (use the Feedback form).  
  
     <h2>Who we are</h2>
      The Phylotastic project is an NSF-funded research project ("Collaborative Research: ABI Development: An open infrastructure to disseminate phylogenetic knowledge", NSF 1458572) with 3 centers and 4 work sites.
